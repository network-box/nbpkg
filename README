This is nbpkg, a tool to interact with the Network Box build system.

It is based on the rpkg framework by Jesse Keating, and largely inspired by the
fedpkg tool from the same author:
    https://fedorahosted.org/rpkg/
    https://fedorahosted.org/fedpkg

The tool should be self-documented, just run it without any argument to see the
available sub-commands and read the help from that.
